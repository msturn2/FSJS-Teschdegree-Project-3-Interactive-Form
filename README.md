Using vanilla JavaScript only, the user's interactivity with a form is augmented to allow registration to a hypothetical conference.  Writing my own scripting, I was able to manipulate the starter HTML and CSS code to create user-friendly experience by:



- Customized conditional behavior and interactivity
- Validation provides error messaging to increase accessibility based user input
- CVV field offers real time validation that reports why validation fails
